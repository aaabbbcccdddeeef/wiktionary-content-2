If there are men who were originally the same as others but have independently become poor and destitute without suffering from any misfortune of famine and drought or illness and '''malignancy''' or calamity and lawsuit, it must be due to their extravagance or to their laziness. Extravagant and lazy persons are poor; diligent and frugal persons are rich.|ref=Hanfeizi}}
