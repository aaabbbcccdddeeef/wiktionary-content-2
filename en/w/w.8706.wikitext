Getting born in the state of Mississippi
Papa was a copper 
and Mama was a hippie

In Alabama she would swing a hammer
Price you gotta pay when you break the panorama
 
She never knew that there was 
Anything more than poor
 
What in the world does your
Company take me for

Black bandana sweet Louisiana
Robbin’ a bank in the state of Indiana

She’s a runner, rebel and a stunner
On her merry way sayin’
Baby watcha gonna

Looking down the barrel of a 
Hot metal 45
Just Another Way To Survive

California rest in peace
Simultaneous release
California show me your teeth
She’s my priestess; I’m Your Priest 

She’s a lover baby and a fighter
Shoulda seen it comin’ when
It got a little brighter

With a name like Dani California
The day was gonna come
When I was gonna mourn ya

A little loaded she was
Stealin’ another breath
I love my baby to death

Who knew the other side of you
Who knew what others died to prove
Too true to say goodbye to you
To true to say say say

Push the fader, Gifted animator
One for the now and eleven for the later

Never made it up to Minnesota
North Dakota was a gunnin’
For the quota
Down in the badlands
She was savin’ the best for last
It only hurts when I laugh
Gone too fast
