[[Category:Dutch strong verbs]]

====Usage notes====
:* When the order of ''jij'' (or the unstressed form ''je'') and ''wordt'' is reversed, the final t is dropped. Compare ''Jij wordt'' (you become) with ''Word jij'' (do you become). This is not the case when the polite form ''u'' is used.

:'''Usage examples'''
:* ''Zij wilde altijd al lerares worden.'': She always wanted to become a teacher.

:;Passive voice
::'''Usage notes'''
::* The subject ondergoes an act. In English the verb to [[be]] is used.
::'''Usage examples'''
::::* ''De muur wordt geschilderd'': The wall is painted
::::* ''De muur werd geschilderd'': The wall was painted
::::* ''De muur zal worden geschilderd'': The wall will be painted
::::* ''De muur is geschilderd (geworden)'': The wall has been painted

::'''Note'''
::*''geworden'' has been put between brackets because it has become archaic to put ''geworden'' at the end of a Dutch passive voice.
