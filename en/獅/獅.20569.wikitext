==Chinese==
{{zh-forms|s=狮|alt=師-archaic}}

===Glyph origin===
{{Han etym}}
{{Han compound|犭|師|ls=psc|c1=s|c2=p|t1=dog; beast}}.

===Etymology===
Originally written as {{zh-m|*師}}. Earliest written attestations in the {{w|Eastern Han}} era include the ''{{w|Book of Han}}'' {{defdate|before 111}}, the surviving portion of the ''{{w|東觀漢記|Dongguan Hanji|lang=zh}}'' {{defdate|{{circa2|150|short=yes}}}}, and {{w|Lokaksema (Buddhist monk)|Lokakṣema}}'s translation of the ''{{w|Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā}}'' {{defdate|179}}. The term is possibly of {{der|zh|ira}} origin. In the ''Book of Han'', the lion was described as indigenous to the historical {{och-l|烏弋山離|id=1,1,1,2|Alexandria}}, possibly {{w|Alexandria Prophthasia}} ({{zh-ref|Yu, 1998}}), which was part of the {{w|Parthian Empire}} at the time. The ''Dongguan'' mentions a lion as a gift from the {{w|Shule Kingdom}} in the year 133, where a {{w|Saka language}} was spoken then. Earlier definite dates associated with the lion mentioned in the ''{{w|Book of the Later Han}}'' include the year 87, when a gift lion from the [[Yuezhi]] was recorded.

Compare {{noncog|ira-pro|*cárguš|t=lion}}. Possibly related to {{och-l|狻猊}}.

Meanwhile, {{zh-ref|Adams (2013)}} postulates possible {{der|zh|ine-toc}} connections; cf. {{cog|txb|ṣecake}} and etymologies.
