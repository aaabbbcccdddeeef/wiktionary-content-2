===Etymology===
{{Han compound|手|丁|c1=s|c2=p|alt1=扌|t1=hand|ls=psc}}

This word was pronounced *''teŋ'' in Old Chinese, as would be expected from a 丁 phonetic. (The word was previously written with 丁 itself before the addition of the 扌 component.) By the early Ming period, the character had been borrowed for another word with the same meaning but a different pronunciation (Middle Chinese ''ta''). There appears to be no etymological relationship between the two words. In Chinese, the new reading became standard; however, derivations of the older pronunciation are still used in Japanese (ちょう ''chō'', てい ''tei'') and Vietnamese (''[[đánh]]'').
