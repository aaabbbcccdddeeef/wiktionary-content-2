{{rfc|zh|</br>* Unattested glyph origin quoted from https://zh-yue.wikipedia.org/wiki/攰</br>* Cantonese pronunciation ''[[gui6]]'' obtained from Unihan database differs from expected fanqie reading of ''[[gwai3]]''</br>* Additional sources needed besides https://yue.forvo.com/word/攰/#yue to verify its pronunciation.</br>* Pronunciation ''[[gwai3]]'', ''[[ci3]]'' obtained from 《粵語同音字典》 may need to be merged with etymology 2 of {{l|zh|㩻#Etymology 2|㩻|gloss='''[[guì]]''' in Mandarin}}}}

===Glyph origin===
{{Han compound|支|t1=limb|力|t2=strength|ls=ic}} – [[limbs]] using a lot of [[strength]], which results in [[tiredness]].

===Etymology 1===
{{zh-forms|alt=癐,䠩}}
{{zh-wp|yue}}
Likely cognate with {{cog|hak|-}} {{zh-l|𤸁|khioi|tired}}.

The etymology is uncertain. This character itself is often regarded as the etymological character ({{zh-l|*本字}}), but the expected Cantonese reflex from the ''fanqie'' found in ''{{w|Jiyun}}'' ({{zh-l|*集韻}}) would be ''gwai<sup>3</sup>'' instead of ''gui<sup>6</sup>''. In recent years, this character has overtaken {{zh-l|*癐}} as the usual way this word is written, probably because of its appearance on the show {{w2|zh|每日一字 (香港)|每日一字}} in the 1980s.

The following are other etymologies that have been proposed:
* {{zh-ref|Bai (1980)}} suggests {{zh-l|䠩|tired}} as the etymological character. This character has been rejected by {{zh-ref|Yan (2000)}} for being a late word.
* {{zh-ref|Yan (2000)}} suggests {{zh-l|*睡|to sleep}} as the etymological character: ''*gljiois'' (Old Chinese, based on Zhengzhang, 1987) > ''*gljioi'' > ''*gioi'' > ''*kioi'' > ''*koi'' > ''*kui'' (Guangzhou), ''*kɔi'' (Yangjiang).
