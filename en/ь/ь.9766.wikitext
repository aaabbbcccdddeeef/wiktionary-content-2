===Letter===
'''Ь''', '''ь''' (''italics: Ь, ь'')

# The twenty-eighth letter of the Bulgarian [[Cyrillic]] alphabet is named '''ер малък''' (er malək, or "little er"). It is only ever used in front of the letter '''о''' (in ''[[шофьор]]'', for example), and never at the beginning of a word. It modifies the "o" sound to "yo." If a "yo" sound is needed at the beginning of a word, the letters [[и|И]] or [[й|Й]] will be used instead. It is preceded in alphabetic order by [[ъ|Ъ]] and followed by [[ю|Ю]].

# The thirtieth letter of the Russian [[Cyrillic]] alphabet. It is named '''мягкий знак''' (mjáxkij znak, or "soft sign") and it has no sound of its own, but modifies that of the preceding consonant, causing it to be pronounced soft (i.e., [[palatal]]ized). In the alphabet, it is preceded by [[ы|Ы]] and followed by [[э|Э]].
