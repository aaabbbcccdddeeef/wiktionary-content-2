# The twenty-eighth letter of the Bulgarian [[Cyrillic]] alphabet is named '''ер малък''' (er malək, or "little er"). It is only ever used in front of the letter '''о''' (in ''[[шофьор]]'', for example), and never at the beginning of a word. It modifies the "o" sound to "yo." If a "yo" sound is needed at the beginning of a word, the letters [[и|И]] or [[й|Й]] will be used instead. It is preceded in alphabetic order by [[ъ|Ъ]] and followed by [[ю|Ю]].

# The thirtieth letter of the Russian [[Cyrillic]] alphabet. It is named [[мягкий знак]]' (mjáxkij znak, or "soft sign") and it has no sound of its own, but modifies that of the preceding consonant, causing it to be pronounced soft (i.e., [[palatal]]ized). In the alphabet, it is preceded by [[ы|Ы]] and followed by [[э|Э]].
# Less commonly just has a traditional orthographic usage with no phonetic meaning (like Russian [[туш]] 'flourish after a toast' and [[тушь]] 'India ink', both pronounced {{IPAchar|[tuʂ]}}, but different in grammatical gender and declension), feminine nouns end with "ь". This rule only applies to nouns ending in [[ч]], [[ш]], [[ж]] and [[щ]]. Verbs in the 2nd person singular end in -ешь, -ёшь, -ишь, the final [[ш#Russian|ш]] is pronounced as {{IPAchar|[ʂ]}}.
# Also, it has a function of "separation sign" ("разделительный мягкий знак"): in Russian, vowels after the soft sign are pronounced separately from the previous consonant and are iotated (compare Russian [[лить|льют]] {{IPAchar|[lʲjut]}} '(they) [[pour]]/[[cast]]' and [[лютый|лют]] [lʲut] '(he is) [[fierce]]').
