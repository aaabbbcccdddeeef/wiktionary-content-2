{{head|bg|letter|sc=Cyrl|lower case||upper case|Ь}} (''italics: Ь, ь'')

# The twenty-eighth letter of the Bulgarian [[Cyrillic]] alphabet is named '''ер малък''' (er malək, or "little er"). It is only ever used in front of the letter '''о''' (in ''[[шофьор]]'', for example), and never at the beginning of a word. It modifies the "o" sound to "yo." If a "yo" sound is needed at the beginning of a word, the letters [[и|И]] or [[й|Й]] will be used instead. It is preceded in alphabetic order by [[ъ|Ъ]] and followed by [[Ю]].

===Letter===
{{head|ru|letter|lower case||upper case|Ь}}

# The thirtieth letter of the Russian [[Cyrillic]] alphabet. It is named {{m|ru|мя́гкий знак||soft sign}} and it has no sound of its own, but instead modifies the preceding consonant, causing it to be pronounced soft (i.e., [[palatal]]ized). In the alphabet, it is preceded by {{m|ru|ы|Ы}} and followed by {{m|ru|э|Э}}.
# Less commonly, it just has a traditional orthographic usage with no phonetic meaning (like Russian {{m|ru|туш||flourish after a toast}} and {{m|ru|тушь||India ink}}, both pronounced {{IPAchar|[tuʂ]}}, but different in grammatical gender and declension), feminine nouns end with "ь". This rule only applies to nouns ending in {{m|ru|ч}}, {{m|ru|ш}}, {{m|ru|ж}} and {{m|ru|щ}}. Verbs in the 2nd person singular end in -ешь, -ёшь, -ишь, the final {{m|ru|ш}} is pronounced as {{IPAchar|[ʂ]}}.
# Also, it has a function of "separation sign" ("разделительный мягкий знак"): in Russian, vowels after the soft sign are pronounced separately from the previous consonant and are iotated. Compare Russian {{m|ru|лить|льют|(they) [[pour]]/[[cast]]}} {{IPAchar|[lʲjut]}} and {{m|ru|лютый|лют|'(he is) [[fierce]]}} {{IPAchar|[lʲut]}}.
