#The thirtieth letter of the Russian [[Cyrillic]] alphabet. It is named '''мягкий знак''' (mjákhkij znak, or "soft sign") and it has no sound of its own, but modifies that of the preceding consonant, causing it to be pronounced soft (i.e., [[palatal]]ized). It is preceded by [[ы|Ы]] and followed by [[э|Э]].
#The twenty-eighth letter of the Bulgarian [[Cyrillic]] alphabet is named '''ер малък''' (er malək, or "little er"). It has no sound, but modifies the preceding consonant to be palatalised. It is preceded by [[ъ|Ъ]] and followed by [[ю|Ю]].
