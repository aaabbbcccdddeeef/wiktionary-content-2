===Glyph origin===
{{rfc|zh|This section contains some unverified claims}}
{{Han etym}}
{{liushu|p}}. The traditional (and incorrect) etymology says that 嘼 originally was a pictogram of an animal, with [[吅]] being the ears, [[囟]] (simplified to [[田]]) being the head, and [[禸]] (simplified to [[𠮛]]) being the tail. This character appears in 獸, and it is a variant of a Y-shape weapon with two rocks on the top, 單 > 单. The wrong etymology can be found in the Shuowen Jiezi. Xu Shen says that this characters means 㹌, "beast".
