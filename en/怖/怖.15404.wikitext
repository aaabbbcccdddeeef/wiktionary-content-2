# to [[fear]]; to be [[afraid]]
#* {{zh-x|吾 聞 言 於 ^接 ^輿，大 而 無-當，往 而 不-反。吾 驚-怖 其 言，猶 河漢 而 無極 也，大 有 逕庭，不-近 人情 焉。|I heard Jie Yu talking words which were great, but had nothing corresponding to them (in reality); once gone, they could not be brought back. I was frightened and '''scared''' by his words; they were like the Milky Way which cannot be traced to its beginning or end. They had no connexion with one another, and were not akin to the experiences of men.|ref=Zhuangzi}}
# to [[scare]]; to [[frighten]]; to [[terrify]]
#* {{zh-x|逢 ^蒙 之 弟子 曰 ^鴻 ^超，怒 其 妻 而 怖 之。引 ^烏號 之 弓，^綦衛 之 箭，射 其 目，矢 來 注 眸子，而 眶 不-睫，矢 隧 地 而 塵 不-揚。|Once Hong Chao, a disciple of the expert archer {{w|Feng Meng}} got mad at his wife, and in order to '''scare''' her he took the powerful Crow's Caw bow and the well-crafted arrow from Qi and shot at her eye. The arrow came right at the pupil of her eye, but she didn’t even blink. The arrow fell to the ground without raising dust. |ref=Liezi}}
