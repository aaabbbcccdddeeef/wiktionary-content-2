===Prefix===
{{ja-pos|k|prefix|hira=お|rom=o}}<br/>
{{ja-pos|k|prefix|hira=ご|rom=go|hidx=こ'}}<br/>

# Prefix indicating that the word is honorific.  Often used to indicate that the word belongs or is related to the listener (as opposed to the speaker).

====Usage notes====
This prefix is frequently written in hiragana, both because it is complicated and common, and because its reading may be ambiguous if the term is unfamiliar. When the prefix is read as ''o-'' (as opposed to ''go-''), it is almost exclusively written in hiragana.

While in general this prefix is optional, in many cases it is so commonly used that the base word can no longer be used in isolation, as in [[御飯]] (ごはん, gohan, rice) – the form ×飯 *''han'' is not used alone, though it can be used as parts of compounds (such as [[炊飯]], ''suihan''), and the character can be read in isolation as ''meshi''.

Usage varies between speakers, situations, and male and female – more polite speech, especially by women, features more use of this prefix, while blunt speech, especially by men, uses it less or not at all (words where it has the prefix become mandatory are replaced by blunter terms that do not have the prefix). In rare cases a prefixed term has become impolite, as in {{term|御前||you (familiar or derogatory)|tr=おまえ, omae|lang=ja}}.

This character is generally read as お (o-) when it is prefixed to words considered to be of Japanese origin, as in [[御水]] (おみず, ''omizu'', ''water''), and ご (go-) when it is prefixed to words considered to be of Chinese origin, as in [[御主人]] (ごしゅじん, ''goshujin'', ''husband'').  There are numerous exceptions, however, such as [[お電話]]. For (non-Chinese) foreign loan words ([[外来語]], [[gairaigo]]), this prefix is seldom used, and both お- and ご- may be used, but お- is somewhat preferred, as in [[おビール]] (''o-bīru'') for beer.

In some rare cases, it is pronounced み (''mi-''), primarily for religious words, pertaining to gods or the emperor, as in [[御輿]] (''mikoshi,'' a type of shrine). However, in this context it is often replaced by [[神]] ("god", also pronounced ''mi-''), and then a further 御 (pronounced お, ''o-'') may be added, as in [[御神輿]] (''o-mi-koshi''). In very rare cases, the prefix 御 (with different pronunciations) may be duplicated or even triplicated, notably in {{term|御御御付け||lang=ja}}, {{term|御御御汁||(polite) miso soup|tr=o-mi-o-tsuke|lang=ja}}, though this can be considered a form of [[ateji]], punning on 御 (honorable) and 味 (flavor) both having the reading ''mi''. The ''mi-'' prefix also became merged into other kanji, as in [[宮]] (''miya,'' imperial palace).

In rare cases, this is used as a suffix instead, notably in [[甥御]] ''oigo'' and [[姪御]] ''meigo'' (your nephew, your niece).

御 (お, ''o-'') should not be confused with [[大]] (おお, ''ō-,'' great), which is a less-commonly used prefix.
