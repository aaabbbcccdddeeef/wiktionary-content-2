===Prefix===
{{ja-pos|k|prefix|hira=お|rom=o}}
{{ja-pos|k|prefix|hira=ご|rom=go|hidx=こ'}}

# Prefix indicating that the word is honorific.  Often used to indicate that the word belongs or is related to the listener (as opposed to the speaker).
#: ''Note: in many cases this prefix has been so completely absorbed into the word that it is inseparable from it, as in ''[[御飯]]'' (ごはん, gohan, rice) and doesn't really indicate anything.''

====Usage notes====
This prefix is frequently written in hiragana.  When the prefix is read as ''o-'' (as opposed to ''go-''), it is almost exclusively written in hiragana.

This character is generally read as お- (o-) when it is prefixed to words considered to be of Japanese origin, as in [[御水]] (おみず, ''omizu'', ''water''), and ご- (go-) when it is prefixed to words considered to be of Chinese origin, as in [[御主人]] (ごしゅじん, ''goshujin'', ''husband'').  There are numerous exceptions, however.
