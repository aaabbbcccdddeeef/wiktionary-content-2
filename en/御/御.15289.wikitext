Appears in the mid-late {{w|Heian period}}.

Shift from {{inh|ja|ojp|大御|tr={{IPAfont|⟨opomi<sub>1</sub>⟩}} → ōmi-|pos=[[prefix]] of [[maximum]] [[honorific]]}}.

Both ''ōmu-'' and ''ōn-'' readings likely existed in free variation until the development of the {{ja-r|ん}} morpheme.

Cognate with {{m|ja|[[霊]], [[神]]|tr=mi||[[spirit]], [[god]]}}, as this prefix was originally used to refer to gods and other spiritually important things.

===Usage notes===
The prefixes ''mi-'' and ''o-'' frequently written in hiragana, both because it is complicated and common, and because its reading may be ambiguous if the term is unfamiliar. When the prefix is read as ''o-'' (as opposed to ''go-''), it is almost exclusively written in hiragana.

While in general this prefix is optional, in many cases it is so commonly used that the base word can no longer be used in isolation, as in {{m|ja|御飯|tr=gohan|| rice}} – the form ×{{m|ja||飯|tr=*han}} is not used alone, though it can be used as parts of compounds (such as {{ja-l|炊飯}}, ''suihan'', “[[rice]] [[cook]]ing”), and the character can be read in isolation as ''meshi''.

Usage varies between speakers, situations, and gender – more polite speech, especially by women, features more use of this prefix, while blunt speech, especially by men, uses it less or not at all (words where the prefix has become mandatory are replaced by blunter terms that do not have the prefix). In rare cases a prefixed term has become impolite, as in {{m|ja|御前|tr=omae||you (familiar or derogatory)}}.

This character is generally read as {{m|ja|お|tr=o-}} when it is prefixed to words considered to be of Japanese origin, as in {{m|ja|御水|tr=omizu||[[water]]}}, and {{m|ja|ご|tr=go-}} when it is prefixed to words considered to be of Chinese origin, as in {{m|ja|御主人|tr=goshujin||[[husband]]}}. There are numerous exceptions, however, such as {{m|ja|お電話|tr=o-denwa}}. For {{m|ja|外来語|tr=gairaigo||(non-Chinese) foreign loan words}}, this prefix is seldom used, and both {{ja-l||お}} and {{ja-l||ご}} may be used, but {{ja-l||お}} is somewhat preferred, as in {{m|ja|おビール|tr=o-bīru||[[beer]]}}.

In some rare cases, it is pronounced {{m|ja|み|tr=mi-}}, primarily for religious words, pertaining to gods or the emperor, as in {{m|ja|御輿|tr=mikoshi||[[portable]] [[shrine]]}}. However, in this context it is often replaced by {{ja-l|神}} ("god", also pronounced ''mi-''), and then a further {{ja-l||御|o-}} may be added, as in {{m|ja|御神輿|tr=o-mikoshi}}. The ''mi-'' prefix also became merged into other kanji, as in {{m|ja|宮|tr=miya||[[imperial]] [[palace]]}}.

In rare cases, this is used as a suffix instead, notably in {{m|ja|甥御|tr=oigo||your [[nephew]]}} and {{m|ja|姪御|tr=meigo||your [[niece]]}}.

{{m|ja||御|tr=o-}} should not be confused with {{m|ja|大|tr=ō-||[[great]]}}, which is a less-commonly used prefix.
