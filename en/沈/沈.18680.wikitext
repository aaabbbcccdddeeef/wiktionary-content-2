===Glyph origin===
{{Han etym}}

In the oracle bone script, it was an {{Han compound|水|羊|ls=ic|nocap=1|t1=water|t2=sheep}} — to submerge a sheep into the water (as a form of sacrifice to the river god). Other forms included {{zh-l|*牛|ox}} or {{zh-l|*玉|jade}} instead of {{zh-l|*羊}}.

Starting from the bronze inscriptions, it became a {{Han compound|水|冘|ls=psc|c1=s|c2=p|t1=water|nocap=1}}.

This character was later borrowed to signify the surname, and the variant {{och-l|沉}} was adopted for the original meaning.
