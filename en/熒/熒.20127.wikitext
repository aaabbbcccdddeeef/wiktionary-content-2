===Glyph origin===
{{Han etym}}
{{liushu|p}} – The protoform is [[𤇾]]. 𤇾 is the pictogram two Intersecting torches, meaning the fire light. In Qin and Han, the crossing of torch "乂" became "冂", and "𤇾" is no longer used as independent character as third "火" (fire) was added into "𤇾". Thus, "熒" was formed.
