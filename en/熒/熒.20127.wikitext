===Glyph origin===
{{Han etym}}
{{liushu|p}} – The protoform is [[𤇾]]. 𤇾 is a pictogram of two intersecting torches, meaning the fire light. In Qin and Han, the crossing of the torches "乂" became "冂", and "𤇾" is no longer used as independent character as a third "火" (fire) was added into "𤇾". Thus, "熒" was formed.

===Etymology===
{{och-l|熒|tr=wêŋ}} belongs to a word-family whose stem is *''weŋ'' "bright, dazzle", which converges with {{och-l|瞬|tr=*win}} "to move the eyes" ({{zh-ref|Schuessler, 2007}}). Other items in the same word-family are:

*{{och-l|眩|tr=wîn(s)?|troubled sight, deluded, deceive}},
*{{och-l|炫|tr=wîns|bright, dazzle, show off}},
*{{och-l|瑩|tr=wreŋ|bright, color of jade > kind of gem}}
*{{och-l|熲|tr=kwêŋʔ|light, flame, blaze}}, which is {{och-l|熒|tr=wêŋ}} with *''k-'' nominalizer.
*{{och-l|榮|tr=wreŋ|flower > flowering, prosperity > glory}}, which is the same word as {{och-l|熒|tr=wêŋ}}.

This word-family could be {{inh|zh|sit-pro|-}} and related to {{cog|lus|ven}} & {{m|lus|veng||to be open; to be unobstructed by trees, clouds, etc; to be clear; to be free of clouds; to be bright (as weather)}} (ibid.).
