[[File:Cholestan.png|thumb|The basic structure of steroids ({{lang|zh|甾}}), featuring the tetracyclic backbone with three side chains.]]

===Glyph origin===
{{Han etym}}
This character is a fusion of two characters which were separate in [[small seal script]].

;“earthenware”
:{{lang|zh|甾}} of this sense was {{och-l|𠙹}} in the [[small seal script]] (古文/ancient variant {{zh-l|*𠙾}} in the Shuowen Jiezi), with three vertical straight strokes on top, representing the {{liushu|p|nocap=1}} of a vessel (缶) made of clay: Xu Shen says 東楚名缶曰甾。象形. This became the current form in the [[clerical]] [[script]]. "Zi" was the name used in Chu to call this kind of vessel.

:This glyph was used as {{och-l|載|id=3}} or proper nouns in oracle bone script.

;“one-year field”
:The glyph of this sense is composed of {{och-l|𡿧}} (“calamity”) and {{och-l|田|field}}. This glyph is also used as an alternative form of {{och-l|災}}. It can be seen in the lower part of {{zh-l|*葘}}.

;“steroid”
:This character was practically obsolete before it was revived as a modern translation for ''[[steroid]]''. It is also a {{liushu|p|nocap=1}} in this sense; the upper part represents the three side chains on the ring system, and the {{lang|zh|田}} component represents the tetracyclic core of steroids. See the image on right.

{{zh-ref|Smith (2011)}} interprets the oracle bone glyph as depicting the new moon and proposes that it originally wrote a word ''*ts[r]əʔ'' "darkened phase" i.e. "new moon", related to {{och-l|緇|tr=*tsrə}} "blackened", {{och-l|菑|tr=*tsrə}} "field cleared by slash and burn", {{och-l|淄|tr=*tsrə}} "murky (water)". Lunar meaning is also present in {{m|zh|臘}} of which this character is the upper-right component.
