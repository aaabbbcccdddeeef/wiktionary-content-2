[[File:Cholestan.png|thumb|The basic structure of steroids ({{lang|zh|甾}}), featuring the tetracyclic backbone with three side chains.]]

===Glyph origin===
{{Han etym}}
This character is a fusion of two characters which were separate in [[small seal script]].

;“earthenware”
:{{lang|zh|甾}} of this sense was {{och-l|𠙾}}-like in the [[small seal script]], with three vertical straight strokes on top, representing the {{liushu|p|nocap=1}} of a bambooware. This became the current form in the [[clerical]] [[script]].

;“one-year field”
:The glyph of this sense is composed of {{och-l|𡿧}} (“calamity”) and {{och-l|田|field}}. This glyph is also used as an alternative form of {{och-l|災}}.

;“steroid”
:This character was practically obsolete before it was revived as a modern translation for ''[[steroid]]''. It is also a {{liushu|p|nocap=1}} in this sense; the upper part represents the three side chains on the ring system, and the {{lang|zh|田}} component represents the tetracyclic core of steroids. See the image on right.
