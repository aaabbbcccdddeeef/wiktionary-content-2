===Etymology 1===
{{zh-forms|alt=唨-rare,阻-rare,左-nonstandard,o左-internet}}
First attested in {{lang|zh|《散語四十章》}} (1877) as {{zh-l|*阻}} ({{zh-ref|Yue, 2004}}).

Probably from {{zh-l|*著/着}}; the pronunciation may be due to influence from Mandarin ''zhuó'' ({{zh-ref|Chan, 1998}}).

{{zh-ref|Chan (1995)}} proposes that the original character is {{ltc-l|𧇣|to go}}; others (including {{w|zh:彭志銘|Jimmy Pang}} and {{w|zh:曾焯文|Chapman Chan}}) have similarly proposed {{ltc-l|徂|to go}} to be the original character. These derivations are phonologically and semantically problematic.
