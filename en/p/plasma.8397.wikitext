===Noun===
'''plasma''' (''plural'', plasma)
#A fundamental state of matter consisting of highly energetic [[charge]]d [[particle]]s that behave collectively to electromagnetic forces. Stars, the space in between, and much of the visible universe consist of plasma. It occurs naturally on Earth in lightning and fire, and artificially in fluourescent light tubes, plasma TVs, and fusion devices where it requries containing by a [[magnetic]] field.  Plasma can be created from superheated gas. First identified by Sir William Crookes in 1879, it was dubbed "plasma" by Irving Langmuir in 1928, because it reminded him of a blood plasma.
#A component of [[blood]] that assists in [[clot]]ting and injury repair.
