* '''Alternate forms''':
* [[莊]] (Traditional; different character in Japan)
* [[荘]] (Simplified Japanese [[shinjitai]])
*:In Chinese 莊 was simplified into 庄, but 庄 already existed as a character. In Traditional Chinese, Japanese, and probably Korean and Vietnamese, 莊/荘 and 庄 remain separate characters.
