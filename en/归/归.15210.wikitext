===Glyph origin===
Unorthodox variant {{Han simp|歸|nocap=y}} found in various {{w|Movable type#Metal movable type in China|moveable type}} copies of {{w|Classic Chinese Novels|classical novels}}. First attested in 《{{w2|zh|宋元以來俗字譜}}》, a {{w|Variant Chinese character|variant forms}} dictionary compiled in 1930 that records unorthodox forms ({{l|zh|俗字}}) that have existed since the {{w|Song dynasty}}. <!-- Refer http://dict.variants.moe.edu.tw/variants/rbt/word_attribute.rbt?educode=A02075-009#33 -->

Originally part of the 324 simplified characters introduced by the {{w|Republic of China}} ({{w|Kuomintang}} government) in 1935 but was later retracted in 1936. <!-- Refer https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ROC24_SC2.jpg -->

Eventually adopted as an official simplified character by the People's Republic of China in the 1956 {{w|Chinese Character Simplification Scheme}}. <!-- Refer https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/漢字簡化方案 -->
