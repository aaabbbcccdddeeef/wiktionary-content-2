===Glyph origin===
{{Han compound|水|步|ls=ic|t1=water|t2=walk}} – to wade across.

Its oracle bone script and bronze inscription were composed of a {{zh-l|*水}} and two {{zh-l|*止|foot}}, depicting two feet on both sides of the water. Two forms, however, were given in ''{{w|Shuowen}}'', with the first one consisting of a {{zh-l|*步}} sandwiched between two {{zh-l|*水}}, and the second a {{zh-l|*水}} to the left of a {{zh-l|*步}}, the predecessor of the current form.
