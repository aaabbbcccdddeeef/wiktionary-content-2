===Etymology===
{{Han etyl}}
{{liushu|p}} – a man bowing over to the left. Significantly abstracted – the middle cross was initially the knee, the stroke at bottom left was the bowed head, and the top was the back-swept hands or clothes.

===Han character===
{{Han char|rn=83|rad=氏|as=00|sn=4|four=72740|canj=HVP}}

====Usage notes====
* ''The third meaning has become largely obsolete, as current Chinese practice is for married women to continue to use their former surnames. The practice of sometimes adopting the husband's surname is being revived, however.'' 氏 ''follows the maiden name, which follows the [[married name]]'' — [[張]]氏 (''née Zhang''), [[李]]張氏 (''Li née Zhang''), ''or'' [[配]]張氏 (''married to a lady of the Zhang clan'').
