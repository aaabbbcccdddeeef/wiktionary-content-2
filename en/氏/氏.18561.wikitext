====Usage notes====
* ''The third meaning has become largely obsolete, as current Chinese practice is for married women to continue to use their former surnames. The practice of sometimes adopting the husband's surname is being revived, however.'' 氏 ''follows the maiden name, which follows the [[married name]]'' — [[張]]氏 (''née Zhang''), [[李]]張氏 (''Li née Zhang''), ''or'' [[配]]張氏 (''married to a lady of the Zhang clan'').
