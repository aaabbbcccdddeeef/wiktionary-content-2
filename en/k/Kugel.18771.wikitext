{{also|kugel}}
==German==

===Pronunciation===
* {{IPA|/ˈkuːɡəl/|lang=de}}

===Etymology 1===
The origin of the word is uncertain, but probably related to that of [[Kegel]] "pin or peg used in a game (such as [[skittles]])"
Outside of loans from German (as in Danish [[kugle]] and Dutch [[kogel]]), it appears only in German, and only from the Middle High German period, as ''kugel, kugele'', referring to a ball used in games ([[Spielkugel]]).
Nevertheless, the word seems to be of genuinely Germanic origin.  A Swiss dialect form has an additional ''r'', in ''krugle'', found already in Middle High German in the diminutive form ''krúgellin'' ([[:w:Konrad of Würzburg|Konrad of Würzburg]], d. 1287).
Middle German variants of the word in the original sense "ball used in skittles or Paille-maille" are ''kaule, kulle'', while Low German had cognates of [[Klotz]].
The sense "bullet" is directly via comparison with the ball in skittles, already in use for lead or iron spheres used as projectiles (fired with slingshots or similar) before firearms became widespread.

====Usage notes====
The German words ''Kugel'' and {{term|Ball|lang=de}} are usually distinguished inasmuch as the former refers to solid balls (such as those used for [[billiards]] or [[bowling]]) while the latter refers to air-filled or elastic balls (such as [[tennis]] or [[soccer]] balls). This distinction may be neglected colloquially or jokingly.
