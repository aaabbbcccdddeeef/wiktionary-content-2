{{also|或|鹹|㖅}}
==Translingual==
{{zh-hanzi-box|咸|[[鹹]]}}
===Etymology===
{{Han compound|戌|口|t1=axe|t2=mouth (person) or clay pot|ls=ic}}. To cut off one's head with an ax, depriving them of all they have; alternatively, to break a pot with an ax.

{{Han simp|鹹|f1=鹵|t1=(none)}} as well.

Note that 咸 is not derived from [[或]], and that the characters 口一 are stacked in the opposite order in these characters. Both are ultimately from {{term|戈||halberd, spear|sc=Hani}}.
