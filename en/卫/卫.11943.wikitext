===Glyph origin===
This character is not known to have existed prior to the simplification of Chinese characters by the People's Republic of China in 1956.

The simplification of {{zh-l|衛*}} to 卫 may have been influenced by the Japanese katakana {{m|ja|ヱ|tr=we}}.

In {{w|Zhongwen Da Cidian}} <big>《中文大辭典》</big>, a dictionary based on the Japanese {{w|Dai Kan-Wa Jiten}} and published in Taiwan from 1962 to 1968, <big>{{l|mul|𠀄}}</big>, a character which is visually similar to <big>卫</big> ({{l|zh|乛}} on top instead of {{l|zh|𠃌}}), is recorded as an unorthodox variant of {{zh-l|衛*}}. <!-- http://www.guoxuedashi.com/kangxi/pic.php?f=zwdcd&p=302 -->

Another theory claims that 卫 is a variant of {{zh-l|𫝀}}, which is the top component of {{zh-l|韋*}} in the middle of {{zh-l|衛*}}.<ref>[https://www.zhihu.com/question/23017758]</ref>
