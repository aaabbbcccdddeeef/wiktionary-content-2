===Glyph origin===
This character is not known to have existed prior to the simplification of Chinese characters by the People's Republic of China in 1956.

The simplification of {{m|zh|衛}} to {{m|zh|卫}} may have been influenced by the Japanese katakana {{m|ja|ヱ|tr=we}}, cf. the Japanese ''[[ryakuji]]'' {{m|ja|⿰彳ヱ}}.

In {{w|Zhongwen Da Cidian}} {{lang|zh|《中文大辭典》}}, a dictionary based on the Japanese {{w|Dai Kan-Wa Jiten}} and published in Taiwan from 1962 to 1968, {{m|zh|𠀄}}, a character which is visually similar to {{m|zh|卫}} ({{m|zh|乛}} on top instead of {{m|zh|𠃌}}), is recorded as an unorthodox variant of {{m|zh|衛}}. <!-- http://www.guoxuedashi.com/kangxi/pic.php?f=zwdcd&p=302 -->

Another theory is that {{m|zh|卫}} is a variant of {{m|zh|𫝀}}, which is the top component of {{m|zh|韋}} in the middle of {{m|zh|衛}}.<ref>[https://www.zhihu.com/question/23017758]</ref>
