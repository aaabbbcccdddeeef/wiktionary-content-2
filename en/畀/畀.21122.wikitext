===Glyph origin===
{{Han etym}}
In the oracle bone script, it was an arrow with a flat arrowhead (cf. {{zh-l|*矢}}, an arrow) – original character of {{och-l|錍|arrow with a flat arrowhead}}.

In the bronze script, a dot was added to the centre, which later became a short line. The bottom of the glyph eventually corrupted into {{zh-l|*廾}} or {{zh-l|*丌}}. On the basis of the latter shape, ''{{w|Shuowen}}'' erroneously interprets the character as a {{Han compound|甶|丌|ls=psc|c1=p|c2=s|t2=pedestal|nocap=1}}.

===Etymology===
From {{inh|zh|sit-pro|*s-bəj-n/k||to give}}. Cognate with {{cog|bo|སྦྱིན||to give, to bestow}}, {{cog|my|ပေး||to give}}.
