===Glyph origin===
{{Han etym}}

Originally an {{Han compound|[[大]] or [[文]]||丨|t1=standing human figure|t2=tilted head with open mouth|t3=cane|ls=ic|nocap=1}} – a man with a cane looking around with his mouth wide open, not know where to go – to be confused; to doubt. Compare: {{zh-l|*欠}} and {{zh-l|*既}}, both showing the "open-mouth" component but on a seated figure. In the oracle bone script and bronze inscriptions, {{zh-l|*彳}} or {{zh-l|*辵}} = {{lang|zh|彳}} + {{zh-l|*止|gloss=foot; toes}} was often added to indicate travelling or movement.

Various components were been added later, e.g. {{zh-l|*牛}} in the bronze script of {{w|Western Zhou}}, {{zh-l|*子}} in the {{w|Qin (state)|Qin}}-style scripts including the proto-[[clerical script]], and {{zh-l|*乙}} in the early clerical script of Western Han. Meanwhile the main graphical element showing a standing figure eventually became {{zh-l|*𠤕}} or sometimes {{zh-l|*矣}} as in the {{w|Chu (state)|Chu}}-style script (shown in the table). The Chu also added a {{zh-l|*心|gloss=heart}} component indicating "the mind".

The ''{{w|Shuowen}}'', in which headwords were written in the Qin-style [[seal script]], interpreted the character as “a child standing on an obstructed road to compare the paths”: {{Han compound|子|止|匕|矢|c1=s|c2=s|c3=s|c4=p|t1=child|t2=to be obstructed|t3=to compare|nocap=1}}. {{w|Duan Yucai}}'s commentary on ''Shuowen'' offered an alternative interpretation, pointing out that {{zh-l|*矢}} was unlikely to have a the phonetic component: {{Han compound|子|𠤕|止|c1=s|c2=s|c3=p|t1=child|t2=uncertain}}. However, it is unlikely that any of the currently extant components had once indicated the pronunciation. {{zh-ref|Zhengzhang (2003)}} conjectured that the {{zh-l|*子}} were a deformed {{och-l|牛}} that had been the phonetic component.

The current form is derived from the Qin–Han scripts, where on the right-hand side the elements {{Han compound|子|止}} or {{Han compound|子|乙}} have recombined into {{Han compound|龴|疋}}.

===Etymology===
Perhaps related to {{och-l|礙|to obstruct}} ({{zh-ref|Schuessler, 2007}}).
