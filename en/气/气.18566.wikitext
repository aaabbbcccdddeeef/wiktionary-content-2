===Glyph origin===
{{Han etym}}
{{liushu|p|rs=气00}}

{{och-l|气}} is a picture of clouds flowing through the sky, and in the oracle bone script, it was simply represented by drawing three horizontal strokes, expressing the "feeling" of the sky. However, in order to avoid confusion with the number {{och-l|三}}, the current {{och-l|气}} was changed to draw a small stroke from top to bottom. The glyph of 气 and [[乞]] comes from the same ancient form.

It also has simplified Chinese usage.
