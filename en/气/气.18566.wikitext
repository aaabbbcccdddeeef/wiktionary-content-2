===Glyph origin===
{{Han etym}}

{{och-l|气}} is a {{liushu|p|rs=气00|nocap=y}} of clouds flowing through the sky. In the oracle bone script, it was represented by three horizontal strokes, expressing the "feeling" of the sky. However, in order to avoid confusion with the number {{och-l|三}}, the current {{och-l|气}} was changed to draw a small stroke from top to bottom. The glyph of {{och-l|氣}} and {{och-l|乞}} comes from the same ancient form.

===Etymology 1===
{{zh-see|氣|sv}}
