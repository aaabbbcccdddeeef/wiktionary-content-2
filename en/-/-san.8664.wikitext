*: {{uxi|ga|a mhadra'''san'''|''his'' dog}}
*: {{uxi|ga|a gcarr dearg'''san'''|''their'' red car}}
* Added to [[pronoun]]s (both simple and prepositional) to add emphasis (''not'' to create a reflexive pronoun):

*: {{uxi|ga|siad'''san''', iad'''san'''|''they'', ''them''}}
* Added to synthetic [[verb]] forms to add emphasis to the subject (third-person plural only as there are no third-person singular synthetic forms):
