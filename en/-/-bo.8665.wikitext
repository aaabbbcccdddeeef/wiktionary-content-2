# Used to form the names of [[resident]]s or inhabitants of particular places, in particular [[towns]]/[[cities]].
#: ''[[Londonbo]]''
#:: [[Londoner]]

====Usage notes====
''-bo'' will work in almost all cases; ''-are'' is more common for certain towns/cities. But also in those cases, ''-bo'' should be considered valid. Note that in some cases, typically when the name of the location is a compound word, an extra ''-s-'' is inserted before ''-bo''. E.g. [[Stockholmsbo]].

''-it'' is even less common, denotes a person with very strong bonds towards the town/city in question; someone who lived there all of his/her life, possibly even with ancestors who lived there too. Only a few towns/cities actually gives rise to commonly used ''-it''-forms, notably [[Malmö]] ("[[Malmöit]]").
