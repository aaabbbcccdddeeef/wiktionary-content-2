====Usage notes====
{{m|sv||-bo}} will work in almost all cases; {{m|sv|-are}} is more common for certain towns/cities. But also in those cases, {{m|sv||-bo}} should be considered valid. Note that in some cases, typically when the name of the location is a compound word, the interfix {{m|sv|-s-}} is inserted before {{m|sv||-bo}}, e.g. {{m|sv|Stockholmsbo}}.

{{m|sv|-it}} is even less common, denoting a person with very strong bonds towards the town or city in question; someone who lived there all of his/her life, possibly even with ancestors who lived there too. Only a few towns/cities give rise to commonly used {{m|sv||-it}}-forms, notably [[Malmö]] ({{m|sv|Malmöit}}).

====Derived terms====
{{suffixsee|sv}}
