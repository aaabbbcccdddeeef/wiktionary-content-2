===Pronunciation===

* {{audio|Nl-hun.ogg|audio|lang=nl}}

===Etymology 1===
====Pronoun====
{{head|nl|pronoun|personal}}

# ''The dative case of the third-person plural personal pronoun:'' [[them]], to them.
# {{lb|nl|proscribed}} ''The accusative case of the third-person plural personal pronoun:'' [[them]].

'''hun''' {{lb|nl|dependent possessive}} (''independent possessive'' '''[[hunne]]''')
# ''The third-person plural possessive pronoun:'' [[their]].

====Usage notes====
The difference between ''hen'' (as direct object) and ''hun'' (as indirect object) does not stem from actual language usage, but was created artificially by the prescriptive grammarian Christiaen van Heule in the 17th century in an attempt to differentiate between the accusative (direct object) and dative case (indirect object); he was inspired by the Latin case system.

In practice, ''hen'' and ''hun'' have always been used interchangeably and many speakers are not aware or have trouble remembering when to use the one or the other, in part because of the rule's artificiality, in part because the distinction in form between the accusative and dative case is not made anywhere else in the language. As a consequence, it is common to hear sentences like these:
* ''Hij heeft '''hun''' verraden.'' (“He has betrayed '''them'''.”)
* ''Ze zijn met '''hun''' uitgegaan.'' (“They have gone out with them.”)

The inverse is also common:
* ''Ik heb het '''hen''' gegeven.'' (“I have given it to them.”)

In an attempt to circumvent this problem, the nominative case can be used for both:
* ''Hij heeft '''ze''' verraden.''
* ''Ze zijn met '''ze''' uitgegaan.''
* ''Ik heb het '''ze''' gegeven.''

In recent years, the interchangeable usage of ''hen'' and ''hun'' is no longer considered erroneous.[http://ans.ruhosting.nl/e-ans/05/02/05/02/03/body.html] For more information, see [[w:nl:Hen of hun|the article in the Dutch Wikipedia]].

===Etymology 2===
Likely a replacement of or based on dialectal Dutch {{m|nl|hullie|}} or a variant thereof, which is a contraction of ''{{l|nl|hunlieden}}'' or ''{{l|nl|hunlui}}'', a compound of ''hun'' ("them") + ''lieden'' or ''lui'' (both meaning "men, people"), which then translates roughly into "them-people". Possibly reinfluenced by or confused with the possessive ''hun''. This etymology explains why usage of ''hun'' occurs only when referring to people, never to objects. 

Also interestingly is the somewhat parallel evolution in daughter language Afrikaans, where ''{{l|af|hulle}}'' is the normal 3rd person plural pronoun, and which has formed similarly from Dutch ''hullie''. For more information, see [[w:nl:Hun als onderwerp|the article in the Dutch Wikipedia]].

====Pronoun====
{{head|nl|pronoun|personal}}

# {{lb|nl|proscribed|regiolectal|Netherlands}} ''The nominative case of the third-person plural personal pronoun:'' [[they]].

====Usage notes====
* Only used for people.
* The use of ''hun'' as a subject is considered incorrect or substandard by most speakers, both in written and spoken language, and only occurs in the Netherlands, not in Belgium and Suriname.
