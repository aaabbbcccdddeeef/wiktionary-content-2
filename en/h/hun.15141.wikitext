==Dutch==

===Pronunciation===
* {{audio|Nl-hun.ogg|audio}}

===Pronoun===
'''hun''' {{context|personal}}

# ''The dative case of the third-person plural personal pronoun:'' [[them]], to them.
# {{context|proscribed|lang=nl}} ''The accusative case of the third-person plural personal pronoun:'' [[them]].
# {{context|proscribed|dialectical|lang=nl}} ''The nominative case of the third-person plural personal pronoun:'' [[they]].

'''hun''' {{context|dependent possessive}} (''independent possessive'' '''[[hunne]]''')
# ''The third-person plural possessive pronoun:'' [[their]].

====Usage notes====
The artificially created distinction between ''[[hen]]'' (for the accusative) and ''hun'' was invented by the seventeenth century scholar [[w:Christiaen van Heule|Christiaen van Heule]], to make Dutch look more like Latin. In practice, many speakers have trouble remembering when to use the one or the other, since this distinction is not made in any other person. Thus it is common to hear sentences like:
* ''Hij heeft '''hun''' verraden.'' (“He has betrayed '''them'''.”)
* ''Ze zijn met '''hun''' uitgegaan.'' (“They have gone out with them.”)

The inverse is also common:
* ''Ik heb het '''hen''' gegeven.'' (“I have given it to them.”)

In an attempt to circumvent this problem, the nominative case can be used for both:
* ''Hij heeft '''ze''' verraden.''
* ''Ze zijn met '''ze''' uitgegaan.''
* ''Ik heb het '''ze''' gegeven.''

The use of ''hun'' for the nominative case, however, is more locally restrained and still widely considered incorrect, mainly in written Dutch.

==Korean==

===Noun===
{{ko-noun|rr|hangeul=훈|hanja=訓|hidx=ㅎ훈}}

# Teaching, instruction, guidance.
# The semantic part of the ''[[eumhun]]'' pairs, which explicates a ''[[hanja]]'' or ''[[Han]]'' ideogram or translates it into an easier or native Korean term. Note the delicate difference from the Japanese counterpart,  ''[[kun#Japanese|kun]]'' pairing with ''[[on#Japanese|on]]''. The other, phonetic part, ''[[eum]]'', is indeed a corrupt or localized version of the actual reading of a Chinese word. 

====Usage notes====
* The common order is ''[[hun]]'' and ''[[eum]]'' (in contrast to ''[[eumhun]]''), e.g., "[[하늘]] 텬" ("''haneul tyeon''", i.e., "[[sky]] ''tyeon''") for [[天]]. 
* The Chinese reading ''tyeon'', corrupted in itself and isolated from Chinese contexts, is marked by great ambiguity. Thus, the ''[[hun]]'' often serves as a qualifier. 

====Antonyms====
* [[eum]]

====Related terms====
* [[eumhun]]

===Pinyin syllable===
'''hun'''

# A transliteration of any of a number of Chinese characters properly represented as having one of four tones, [[hūn]], [[hún]], [[hǔn]] or [[hùn]].

====Usage notes====
English transcriptions of Chinese speech often fail to distinguish between the critical tonal differences employed in the Chinese language, using words such as this one without the appropriate indication of tone.
