# {{context|proscribed|lang=nl}} ''The accusative case of the third-person plural personal pronoun:'' [[them]].
# {{context|proscribed|dialectical|lang=nl}} ''The nominative case of the third-person plural personal pronoun:'' [[they]].

====Usage notes====
The distinction between ''[[hen]]'' (for the accusative) and ''hun'' is an artificially created one.  It was invented by the seventeenth century scholar [[w:Christiaen van Heule|Christiaen van Heule]], to make Dutch look more like Latin.  In practice almost everybody has trouble remembering when to use the one or the other, since this distinction is not made in any other person.  Thus it is common to hear sentences like:
* ''Hij heeft '''hun''' verraden.'' (“He betrayed '''them'''.”)
* ''Ze zijn met '''hun''' uitgegaan.'' (“They went out with them.”)

The inverse is also common:
* ''Ik heb het '''hen''' gegeven.'' (“I gave it to them.”)

In written texts, care is usually taken to make ‘correct’ use of them.  To circumvent this problem, often the nominative case is used for both, although doing so is not generally accepted.
* ''Hij heeft '''ze''' verraden.''
* ''Ze zijn met '''ze''' uitgegaan.''
* ''Ik heb het '''ze''' gegeven.''

The use of ''hun'' for the nominative case, however, is more locally restrained and still generally considered wrong.

'''hun'''

# A transliteration of any of a number of Chinese characters properly represented as having one of four tones, [[hūn]], [[hún]], [[hǔn]], or [[hùn]].

English transcriptions of Chinese speech often fail to distinguish between the critical tonal differences employed in the Chinese language, using words such as this one without the appropriate indication of tone.
