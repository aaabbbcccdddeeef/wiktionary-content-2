====Usage notes====
The mythical ancestor of the Lu family is [[Shennong]], the inventor of agriculture and older brother to the [[Yellow Emperor]], one of five legendary emperors who lived over 5,000 years ago, in an era predating the [[Xia Dynasty]], the first historical dynasty of China. The historical ancestor is [[Jiang Ziya]], who helped the [[Zhou Dynasty]] overthrow the corrupt [[Shang dynasty]] in the 11th century BCE. Later on, Jiang Ziya's grandson was given some land in Northern China called Lu, and from that plot of land he took his surname. And so the Lu family was born.
