===Hanja===

# Used in placename (See [[심천]])

* Note: the pronunciation [[수]](''su''), which is attested as standard in most of Korean hanja dictionaries, is reconstructed from [[Fanqie]], whereas [[천]](''cheon'') is derived from the modern Chinese pronunciation. As this hanja is not used in common Sino-Korean words, 천 is used in most of Korean dialogues and documents.
