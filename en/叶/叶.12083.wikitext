===Glyph origin===
{{Han etym}}
{{Han compound|口|十|ls=ic|t1=mouth|t2=ten}} – many voices in harmony. It is used as a variant of {{och-l|協}} since antiquity. {{och-l|十}} may also act as a phonetic component.

It was later borrowed for {{m|zh|葉}} because {{m|zh|協}} and {{m|zh|葉}} are homophones in {{etyl|wuu|-}}. This usage was made official in Simplified Chinese.

===Etymology 1===
{{zh-see|協|v}}

===Etymology 2===
{{zh-see|葉|sv}}
