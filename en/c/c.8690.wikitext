===Etymology===

the third letter of the Roman alphabet, was originally identical with the Greek ''gamma,'' Γ, and [[Semitic]] ''gimel,'' whence it derived its form through the successive types [[Image:Earlier Gamma.GIF]], [[Image:Early Gamma.GIF]], C. The Greek ''kappa, K,'' being from the first little used by the Romans, C functioned in earlier Latin both as /g/ and /k/; the latter sound being the more frequent came to be viewed as the more appropriate to C, and about 300-­230 b.c., a modified character, [[Image:Earlier Latin G.GIF]] or [[Image:Early Latin G.JPG]], was introduced for the /g/ sound, and C itself retained for the /k/ sound. Hence, in the classical period and after, G was treated as the phonetic representative of gamma, and C as the equivalent of kappa, in the transliteration of Greek words into Roman spelling, as in ''KA∆MOΣ, KYPOΣ, ΦΩKIΣ,'' in Roman letters CADMVS, CYRVS, PHOCIS.

When the Roman alphabet was introduced into Britain, C had only the sound /k/ and this value of the letter has been retained by all the [[insular]] Celts: in [[Welsh]], Irish, [[Gaelic]], C, c, is still only /k/. The [[wikipedia:Old English|Old English]] or “Anglo-Saxon” writing was learned from the Celts, apparently of Ireland; hence C, c, in Old English, was also originally /k/: the words ''kin, break, broken, thick, seek,'' were in Old English written ''cyn, brecan, brocen, Þicc, séoc''. But during the course of the Old English period, the k-sound before ''e'' and ''i'' became [[wikipedia:palatalization|palatalized]], and had by the 10th century advanced nearly or quite to the sound of {{IPAchar|/tʃ/}}, though still written c, as in ''cir(i)ce, wrecc(e)a''. On the continent, meanwhile, a similar phonetic change had also been going on. Original Latin C (= k) before ''e, i,'' had by palatalization advanced in Italy to the sound of {{IPAchar|/tʃ/}}, and in France still further to that of /ts/. Yet for these new sounds the old character C, c, was still retained before ''e'' and ''i,'' the letter thus acquiring two distinct values. Moreover the sound /k/ also occurred in French before ''e'' and ''i'' (chiefly as a representative of Latin qu); this was now expressed in Northern French by the Greek letter ''K,'' k; so that the sound /k/ had two symbols, ''k'' and ''c,'' while the symbol c had two sounds (/k/ and /ts/). These French inconsistencies as to C and K were, after the [[wikipedia:Norman Conquest|Norman Conquest]], applied to the writing of English, which caused a considerable re-spelling of the Old English words. Thus while Old English ''candel, clif, corn, crop, cú,'' remained unchanged, ''Cent, cæ´[[Image:Insular G.gif]] (cé´[[Image:Insular G.gif]]), cyng, brece, séoce,'' were now (without any change of sound) spelt ''Kent, keŠ, kyng, breke, seoke;'' even ''cniht'' was subsequently spelt ''kniht, knight,'' and ''Þic, Þicc,'' became ''thik, thikk, thick''. The Old English cw- was also at length (very unnecessarily) displaced by the French ''qw, qu,'' so that the Old English ''cwén, cwic,'' became [[wikipedia:Middle English|Middle English]] ''qwen, quen, qwik, quik,'' now ''queen, quick''. The sound {{IPAchar|/tʃ/}} to which Old English palatalized c had advanced, also occurred in French, chiefly (in Central French) from Latin ''c'' before ''a''. In French it was represented by ''ch,'' as in ''champ, cher: ''–Latin ''camp-um, caōr-um; '' and this spelling was now introduced into English: the Hatton Gospels, written about 1160, have in Matt. i-iii, ''child, chyld, riche, mychel,'' for the ''cild, rice, mycel,'' of the Old English version whence they were copied: this was, phonetically, an improvement. In these cases, the Old English ''c'' gave place to ''k, qu, ch;'' but, on the other hand, c in its new value of /ts/ came in largely in French words like ''processiun, emperice, grace,'' and was also substituted for ''ts'' in a few Old English words, as miltse, bletsien, in early Middle English ''milce, blecien''. By the end of the 13th c. both in France and England, this sound /ts/ was reduced to simple /s/; and from that date c before e, i, y, has been, phonetically, a duplicate or subsidiary letter to s; used either for ‘etymological’ reasons, as in lance, cent, or (in defiance of etymology) to avoid the ambiguity due to the ‘etymological’ use of s for /z/, as in ''ace, mice, once, pence, defense''.

Thus, on the plea of showing the etymology, we write ''advise, devise,'' instead of ''advize, devize,'' which obliges us to write ''advice, device, dice, ice, mice, twice,'' etc., in defiance of the etymology; bad example has extended this to ''hence, pence, defence,'' etc., where there is no plea whatever for ''c''. Former generations also wrote ''sence'' for sense.

Hence, in modern English, C has (a) the ‘hard’ sound /k/ before ''a, o, u,'' before a consonant (except ''h''), and when final, as in ''cab, cot, cut, claw, crow, acme, cycle, sac, tic, epic;'' (b) before ''e, i, y,'' it has the ‘soft’ sound /s/. In all words from Old English or [[wikipedia:Old French|Old French]], final ''c'' is avoided: the /k/ sound being written ''k'' or ''ck,'' as in ''beak, meek, oak, book, bark, balk, bank, pack, peck, pick, rock''. This is probably due to the claims of derivatives like ''meeker, oaken, barking, rocky,'' where ''c'' could not be used. Final ''c'' however is written in modern words from Latin, Greek, or other languages, and (of late) in the ending ''-ic,'' as in ''sac, tic, epic, critic, music, picnic''. In the rare cases in which this ''c'' is followed in inflexion by ''e'' or ''i,'' it is necessary to change it to ''ck,'' as in ''physicking, mimicking, frolicking, trafficker, picnicker''. When the /s/ sound is final, it must be written -ce, as in trace, ice, thrice, and this final e must be retained in composition before ''a, o, u,'' as in ''trace-able, peace-able''. (c) ''Ci'' (rarely ''ce'') preceding another vowel has frequently the sound of {{IPAchar|/ʃ/}}, especially in the endings ''-cious, -cial, -cion,'' as ''atrocious, glacial, coercion (ocean)''. This sound (which is also taken by ''t'' in the same position) has been developed in comparatively modern times by palatalization of /s/.

In a few words from foreign languages, c retains the foreign pronunciation, as in the Italian ''cicerone'' {{IPAchar|[tʃitʃe'rone]}}.

The combination CH virtually constitutes a distinct letter, having a history and sound of its own, and as such it receives a separate place in the alphabet of some languages, e.g. Spanish, Welsh. In English it is not so treated, and the ''ch-'' words are placed in dictionaries and alphabetical lists between ce- and ci-. This inclusion of ch in the middle of C is one reason why the latter occupies so large a space dictionaries: C is virtually two letters in one, since beside the series ''ca-, ce-, ci-, cl-,'' etc., there is the parallel series ''cha-, che-, chi-, chl-,'' etc.
