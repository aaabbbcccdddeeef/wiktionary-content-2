===Etymology===
From {{term|占める|tr=shimeru|lang=ja}}, as cursive form of top component ト (also [[〆]]). Then applied to other kanji of the same pronunciation, namely 締め, 閉め, and 絞め, all pronounced しめ ''shime.'' Sense of “closed, fastened” is due to {{term|閉める||to close|tr=shimeru|lang=ja}} and {{term|締める||to fasten|tr=shimeru|lang=ja}}.

===Kanji===
{{ja-kanji|grade=uc|rs=丿01}}

# "letter closed" character (from 閉める, ''close'')
# [[sum]] (from 〆高, [[締高]], ''sum'')
# [[measurement]] of [[paper]]
# [[bundle]] (from [[締める]], ''fasten'')

====Derived terms====
〆 is primarily used as an abbreviation for 締 (sometimes 閉), in 締める (〆る), 締切 (〆切), and [[締高]] (〆高). Another rarer use is 〆粕, (for 搾め糟, [[しめかす]]), and there is also occasional use of 乄, as in 乄高.
