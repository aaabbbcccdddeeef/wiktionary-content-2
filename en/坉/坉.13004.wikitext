# {{rfv-sense}} [[water]] that does not [[recede]] and cannot be [[divert]]ed {{attention|cmn|It would be helpful if someone could provide an example of how this is used. Is a pond a "坉"? It has nowhere to recede or be diverted to, assuming it is rain-fed rather than fed by a river. If a river floods and the water doesn't seem likely to recede for several days, and the town has to be evacuated, are the floodwaters "坉" until they do recede?}}
