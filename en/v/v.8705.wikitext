==English==

===Etymology===
From {{etyl|enm}} lower case letter {{term|v}} (also written {{term|u}}), from {{etyl|ang}} lower case {{term|u|lang=ang}} and respelling of {{etyl|ang}} {{term|f|lang=ang}} between vowels and voiced consonants.
* [[Image:Rune-Feoh.png|10px|Anglo-Saxon Futhorc letter {{term||·ö†|tr=f|feoh}}]] {{etyl|ang}} lower case {{term|f|lang=ang}} from 7th century replacement by Latin lower case {{term|f|lang=la}} of the Anglo-Saxon Futhorc letter {{term|·ö†|tr=f||feoh}}, derived from Etruscan letter {{term|êåÖ|tr=v}}.
* [[Image:Rune-Ur.png|10px|Anglo-Saxon Futhorc letter {{term||·ö¢|tr=u|ur}}]] {{etyl|ang}} lower case {{term|u|lang=ang}} from 7th century replacement by Latin lower case {{term|v|lang=la}} of the Anglo-Saxon Futhorc letter {{term|·ö¢|tr=u||ur}}, derived from Raetic letter {{term||u}}.

Before the 1700s, the pointed form {{term|v}} was written at the beginning of a word, while a rounded form {{term|u}} was used elsewhere, regardless of sound.  So whereas {{term|valor}} and {{term|excuse}} appeared as in modern printing, {{term|have}} and {{term|upon}} were printed {{term||haue}} and {{term||vpon}}. Eventually, in the 1700s, to differentiate between the consonant and vowel sounds, the {{term|v}} form was used to represent the consonant, and {{term|u}} the vowel sound.  {{term|v}} then preceded {{term|u}} in the alphabet, but the order has since reversed.

====Usage notes====
The common letter names, as well as phrases like {{term|ve de vaca}} are used to distinguish the letter {{term|v}} from the letter {{term|b|lang=es}}.  This is done because the two letters represent a single phoneme in modern Spanish, causing their traditional names {{term|be|lang=es}} and {{term|ve|lang=es}} both to be pronounced as {{IPAchar|['beÃûÀë]}}.
