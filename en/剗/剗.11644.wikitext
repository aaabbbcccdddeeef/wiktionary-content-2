===Usage notes===
In Taiwan ({{w|traditional Chinese}}) 剗 is considered as the variant form of [[剷]]. However, the official form [[剷]] is less widely used compared to 剗. In mainland China ({{w|simplified Chinese}}), 剗 is simplified to [[刬]] while [[剷]] (traditional variant of 剗) is considered a variant character of [[鏟]] that is simplified to [[铲]]. In mainland China, [[刬]]/剗 carries the meaning of [[destroy]]/[[abolish]]/[[exterminate]] while [[铲]] (derived from [[鏟]]/[[剷]]) means to [[shovel]]/[[level]] off/[[root]] up.
