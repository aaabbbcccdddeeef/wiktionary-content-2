===Glyph origin===
{{Han etym}}

Oracle bone script: {{liushu|p}} – an alcohol vessel ({{zh-m|*酉}}) placed on a mat ({{zh-m|*一}}).

In the bronze inscriptions, two strokes ({{zh-m|*八}}) were sometimes added above the alcohol vessel, representing overflowing alcohol; this is inherited in the small seal script as {{zh-l|*酋}}. In some bronze inscriptions, two horizontal strokes were sometimes also added below the line representing a mat; the strokes sometimes were changed to something like {{zh-m|*八}}. These two strokes then fused with the mat to give {{zh-m|*丌}} (a table with two legs) in the small seal script. {{zh-m|*丌}} later evolved into {{zh-m|*大}} by process of ''libian'' ({{zh-l|*隸變}}).
