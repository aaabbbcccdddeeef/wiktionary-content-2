===Etymology===
This character was not listed in Sui/Tang rhyme books. First attested in Jin/Yuan-era novels, when it was also written as {{ltc-l|恁}}, and occurred predominantly in attributive environments, forming complementary distribution with {{zh-l|你}} in other cases. Originally, {{lang|zh|您}} was a pronoun for both 2nd sg. and 2nd pl., and {{zh-l|你每}} (> {{zh-l|你們}}) was an equilibrating disyllabic version of 您, which retains the -m syllable coda of {{lang|zh|您}} disappearing in Mandarin. Later, in the Beijing dialect, -{{zh-l|們}} was restricted to purely a plural suffix, and {{lang|zh|您}} restricted to purely a 2nd sg. honorific pronoun, although the 2nd pl. hon. {{zh-l|您們}} is still considered ungrammatical by some speakers. The plural sense of {{lang|zh|您}} is retained in the Tianjin dialect:
{{zh-x|您 了 先 聊，我 到 外頭 溜達{da} 溜達{da}。|Please continue your conversation. I'll just be having a walk outside.|M-TJ}}
