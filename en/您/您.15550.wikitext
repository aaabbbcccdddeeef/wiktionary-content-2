{{zh-forms|alt=恁,儜-honorific}}<!-- 𠑓? -->

===Glyph origin===
{{Han etym}}
{{Han compound|你|t1=you|心|t2=heart|ls=ic}}. {{ltc-l|心}} may also phonetically signify the original ''-m'' ending ({{zh-ref|Yuan et al., 1996}}).

===Etymology===
This character was not listed in {{w|Sui dynasty|Sui}}/{{w|Tang dynasty|Tang}} rhyme books. First attested in {{w|Jin dynasty|Jin}}/{{w|Yuan dynasty|Yuan}}-era literature, when it was also written as {{zh-l|*恁}} and probably pronounced as ''*nim'' at the time ({{zh-ref|Lü, 1940}}; {{zh-ref|Norman, 1988}}). The pronoun was used both in the singular and the plural.

The pronoun used in Jin/Yuan-era literature is generally thought to be a fusion of {{zh-l|你們|you (plural)}} or {{zh-l|你每|you (plural)}} ({{zh-ref|Lü, 1940}}; {{zh-ref|Norman, 1988}}). Compare {{zh-l|怹|he, she (polite)}} ( < {{zh-l|他們|they}}).

The honorific usage may simply be a development of the plural usage ({{zh-ref|Norman, 1988}}); compare {{noncog|en|you}}, {{noncog|fr|vous}}. However, others have argued for a different etymology for the honorific pronoun. {{zh-ref|Wang (1984)}} and {{zh-ref|Lü (1985)}} argue that it is a contraction of {{zh-l|*你老|you (honorific for seniors)}}: {{IPAchar|/ni lau/}} → {{IPAchar|/nil/}} → {{IPAchar|/nin/}}. Alternatively, {{zh-ref|Zhang (2001)}} suggests that it comes from {{ltc-l|仁}}, an honorific used in Buddhist texts from the {{w|Han dynasty}}.

In {{cog|yue|-}} and {{cog|hak|-}}, this character is simply read as {{zh-l|*你}}; in {{cog|zhx-teo|-}}, it is read as {{zh-l|*汝}}.
