===Usage notes===
* This character was invented by a Chinese library sciences expert named Du Dingyou (杜定友)　in Japan in the early 20th century.  He apparently invented the character because he felt that it was too much of a hassle to write the word for library using three Chinese characters.  Instead, he suggested merging the three characters into one, hence 図書館 (圖書館 in Traditional Chinese) became 圕.  However, the pronunciation (''toshokan'' in Japanese, ''túshūguǎn'' in Mandarin) is identical to the more traditional way of writing the word.  For this reason, 圕 is one of the few multi-syllabic Chinese characters in Mandarin, but it has never gained widespread acceptance as a legitimate Chinese character within China, where it is thought of as a Japanese-invented character (''[[kokuji]]'' 国字).  The character was also much more common in Japan, where it appeared in the name of library science journal 圕研究 ''Toshokan Kenkyū''. <ref>[http://hp.vector.co.jp/authors/VA000964/html/tosho.htm "''Toshokan to iu moji''"]</ref><ref>[http://http://ksbookshelf.com/nozomu-oohara/Nikkei.htm "''Kokuji no sekai, netto ni hiraku''"]</ref>
