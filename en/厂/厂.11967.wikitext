# Kangxi radical 27 "cliff"

====Readings====
{{ja-readings
|on=かん,げん,ごん
|kun=がんだれ,いしだれ
}}
<!--

====Readings====
* ショウ・おおや・うまや（廠）, アン・いおり（庵）, がんだれ（厂）

====Usage notes====
The two traditional characters are quite unrelated, thus the Japanese reading depends on which character is meant.
The modern simplified character does not occur by itself in Japanese, but it has a reading in order to describe it as part of other characters. As a radical (''bushu'') it is referred to as がんだれ from its use as the outer element in the character for "goose" 雁（ガン・かり）. The shape of 厂 originally meant "cliff" and occurs in Japanese kanji such as 崖（がけ）"cliff" or 岸（きし）"bank (of river)".
