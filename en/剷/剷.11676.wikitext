===Usage notes===
In Taiwan ({{w|traditional Chinese}}), [[剗]] is considered as the variant form of 剷. However, the official form 剷 is less widely used compared to [[剗]]. In mainland China ({{w|simplified Chinese}}) 剷 is considered a variant character of [[鏟]] that has been simplified to [[铲]]. See also the [[剗#Usage_notes|usage notes]] of [[剗]] for the difference between [[刬]] and [[铲]] in simplified Chinese.
