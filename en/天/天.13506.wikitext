===Glyph origin===
{{Han etym}}
A top line representing the level above a man with outstretched arms ({{zh-l|大}}). Ancient representations of the character depicted a man with a large head, an anthropomorphic representation of heaven.

Original meaning of the word is “sky”. Such concept is difficult to depict with a pictogram, hence the current form. Perhaps influenced by the glyph, the character was frequently glossed in Old Chinese documents with {{zh-l|*顛|crown of the head}}, and such had led to incorrect hypotheses which regarded {{zh-l|天}} as a derivation of {{zh-l|*顛}} or {{zh-l|*巔}}, “top (of the head/hill)”.

===Etymology===
This character was previously reconstructed to have a {{IPAchar|/*tʰ/}}-initial in Old Chinese, but this hypothesis has been largely discounted in recent reconstructions, in light of evidence from early Chinese accounts of dialectal pronunciations, transcription of other languages, as well as cognate/derived characters within Chinese, which has all pointed to a voiceless resonant initial {{IPAchar|/*l̥-/}} in Old Chinese. According to [https://ctext.org/shi-ming/shi-tian/zh chapter 1] of ''{{w|Shiming}}'', by c. 200 {{CE}}, this initial had already produced dialectal variation in the pronunciation: People in central-western China pronounced it with the back of the tongue, like {{ltc-l|顯}}, while people in eastern China pronounced it with the tip of the tongue, like {{ltc-l|坦}}. An old northwestern dialect variant survives as {{ltc-l|祆|God of the [[Zoroastrian]]s}}, and the word {{ltc-l|天竺|id=1,2|India}} was used to transcribe Old Persian *''Hind-uka'' ("India").

Further etymology is unknown. During the time when this term was reconstructed with a {{IPAchar|/*tʰ-/}} initial, it was frequently compared with ''{{w|tengri}}'', the name for God in early Turkic and Mongolic peoples' languages. This now appears unlikely. The only certain external cognate is the {{cog|bca|-}} (a language closely related to Chinese) word {{m|bca|heinl||sky, heaven}} {{IPAchar|/xẽ⁵⁵/}}. {{zh-ref|Chen (1998)}} proposes cognation with {{och-l|祁連|tr=*g'ieg-lian}} and {{och-l|赫連|tr=*khak-lian}}, transcriptions of a Xiongnu word for "sky", which he also relates to {{och-l|昊天|tr=*g'ôg-hlin}}.
