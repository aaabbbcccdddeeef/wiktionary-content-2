===Glyph origin===
{{Han etym}}
<!--Alternatively: {{Han compound|彳|步|ls=ic}}.-->
During the Zhou dynasty, {{lang|zh|徙}} was represented with the phonetic borrowing {{och-l|屎|excrement}}, with the components {{lang|zh|辵}} and {{lang|zh|止}} later being added to differentiate the character used to represent "migration". During the Warring States period, the earlier forms of {{lang|zh|屎}} consisting of {{zh-l|*小}} or {{zh-l|*少}} components (as seen in [[File:屎-oracle-2.svg|23px]] and [[File:屎-oracle.svg|23px]]) had these portions transform into {{zh-l|*米}}, however {{lang|zh|徙}} continued to retain the {{lang|zh|少}} form. The Chu script form of {{lang|zh|屎}} corrupted into a form with the {{zh-l|*尸}} ("body") component becoming {{zh-l|*尾}} ("tail"), while the Qin script form of {{lang|zh|徙}} omitted the {{lang|zh|尸}} component of {{lang|zh|屎}} and left only {{zh-l|*少}} remaining. The [[clerical script]] form inherited the Qin script form, however had the {{lang|zh|少}} component mutate into another {{lang|zh|止}}, which coincidentally resulted in the clerical form matching the same character structure as {{zh-l|*歨}} (the Shang dynasty form of {{zh-l|*步}}) with an additional {{lang|zh|彳}} component.

''[[w:Shuowen Jiezi|Shuowen Jiezi]]'' erroneously takes this mutated clerical script form of {{lang|zh|徙}} with two {{lang|zh|止}} components, and claims that it is a {{Han compound|辵|止|c1=s|c2=p|t1=walk|ls=psc}}. It also omits one of the {{lang|zh|止}} components to create an alternate form {{zh-l|*𢓊}}, however no such character exists in ancient writing (although coincidentally has a similar shape to the Shang and Zhou {{zh-l|*延}}). The "ancient script" form of {{lang|zh|徙}} in ''Shuowen'', {{zh-l|*𡲴}}, comes from a corruption of the variant form featuring {{lang|zh|尾}} in place of {{lang|zh|尸}}, but with the tail portion misrepresented as {{zh-l|*火}}. For this reason, the "ancient script" forms of {{lang|zh|徙}} provided in ''Shuowen'' are extremely corrupted.

Li Shoukui (2015) notes that the ancient form of {{lang|zh|屎}}, namely {{lang|zh|⿸尸少}}, may suggest that {{lang|zh|從}} is a {{Han compound|辵|沙|c1=s|c2=p|t1=walk|ls=psc|abb2=yes}}.<ref>Li Shoukui (李守奎), 2015.
