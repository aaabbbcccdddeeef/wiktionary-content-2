===Noun===
{{infl|ko|noun}} ([[음]]; [[音]])

# Sound
# The phonetic part of the ''[[eumhun]]'' pairs for a ''[[hanja]]'' or ''[[Han]]'' ideogram, which is indeed a corrupt or localized version of the actual reading of a Chinese word. The other, semantic part is rather lexical than practical to explicate the ''[[hanja]]'' or translate it into an easier or native Korean term. This makes a delicate difference from the Japanese counterpart, ''[[kun#Japanese|kun]]'', often used in everyday passages. 

====Usage notes====
* The common order is ''[[hun]]'' and ''[[eum]]'' (in contrast to ''[[eumhun]]''), e.g., "[[하늘]] 텬" ("''haneul tyeon''", i.e., "[[sky]] ''tyeon''") for [[天]]. 
* The Chinese reading ''tyeon'', corrupted in itself and isolated from Chinese contexts, is marked by great ambiguity. Thus, the ''[[hun]]'' often serves as a qualifier. 

====Antonyms====
* [[hun]]
