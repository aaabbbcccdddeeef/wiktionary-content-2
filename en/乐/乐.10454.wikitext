===Glyph origin===
Unorthodox variant {{Han simp|樂|nocap=y}} found in a {{w|Movable type#Metal movable type in China|moveable type}} copy of <big>《嶺南逸事》</big>. First attested in 《{{lw|zh|宋元以來俗字譜}}》, a {{w|Variant Chinese character|variant forms}} dictionary compiled in 1930 that records unorthodox forms ({{l|zh|俗字}}) that have existed since the {{w|Song dynasty}}. Also found as a {{w|Cursive script (East Asia)|cursive form}} ({{lw|zh|草書}}) of {{l|zh|樂}} in <big>《中國書法大字典》</big>.

Eventually adopted as an official simplified character by the People's Republic of China in the 1956 {{w|Chinese Character Simplification Scheme}}. <!-- Refer https://zh.wikisource.org/wiki/漢字簡化方案 -->
