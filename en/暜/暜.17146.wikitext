===Glyph origin===
{{Han etym}}

===Etymology 1===
{{zh-see|替|a|to [[substitute]]}} <!--《廣韻·去聲·霽·替》替：『廢也，代也，滅也。《說文》本作暜廢一偏下也。他計切，二十。』-->

===Etymology 2===
{{zh-see|普|a|[[universal]], [[widespread]]}} <!--《康熙字典》普：『《唐韻》滂古切，音浦。《說文》作暜，日無色也。《註》日無光則遠近皆同，故从竝。』-->

===Usage notes===
Note that etymology 1 applies to the character with [[曰]] as the bottom component (U+2F8D5) while etymology 2 applies to the character with [[日]] as the bottom component (U+669C). When {{w|regular script}} ([[楷書]]) became the more prominent style in {{w|Chinese script styles|Chinese calligraphy}}, the component [[竝]] in 暜 was simplified to [[替]] and [[普]] respectively to avoid confusion between the two forms.
