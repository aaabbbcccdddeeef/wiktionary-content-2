===Glyph origin===

{{Han etym}}
{{Han compound|人|alt1=亻|農|ls=psc|c1=s|c2=p}}.

===Etymology 1===
“Person; I; me > ''suffix for pronouns''” in southeastern dialects.

Its senses of “person; human being” and “''pronoun suffix''” are well-attested in the classical literature, dating back to the {{w|Six Dynasties}}. At the present time, traces of this word are found in regions of [[Jiangsu]] (Northern Wu), [[Anhui]] (Hui), [[Shanghai]] (Northern Wu), [[Zhejiang]] (Southern Wu), [[Jiangxi]] (Gan), [[Fujian]] (Min), [[Guangdong]] (Southern Min, Cantonese), [[Guangxi]] (Cantonese) and [[Hainan]] (Min).

; “Person; human”
: In coastal Min (Min Dong, Min Nan and Puxian Min), it serves as the vernacular reading of {{och-l|人|person}}, by itself or in compounds. It is also used in Jinqu Wu dialects (formerly classified as Wuzhou Wu and Chuqu Wu), usually written as {{zh-l|*農}}.

; “I”
: {{lang|zh|儂}} was used to mean “I” in medieval poetry from the Wu region, before it was displaced by the common Chinese {{ltc-l|我|I}}. Also attested was ancient Wu {{ltc-l|阿儂|I}}, which was abbreviated to {{zh-l|*阿|I}} in certain dialects, such as {{w|Jinhua}}.

; “''Pronoun suffix''”
: This is widely found in Wu and Min dialects. The structure ‹ ''singular pronoun'' (“I, you, he/she/it”) + {{lang|zh|儂}} › is common, with {{lang|zh|儂}} functioning either as a meaningless particle or a pluraliser. The resulting forms were thus used to mean singular or plural pronouns, and were rather prone to [[elision]] to become a single syllable. Compare the following plural pronouns in Min:

: {| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"

|-
! {{zh-l|*我儂}} !! we
| ''ua neiŋ'' || ''gua laŋ'' || ''gun'' ({{zh-l|*阮}}) || ''kuoŋ ~ kŋ'' ({{zh-l|*滾}})
|-
! {{zh-l|*儂儂}} !! we (''inclusive'')
| - || ''laŋ laŋ'' || ''lan'' ({{zh-l|*咱}}) || -
|-
! {{zh-l|*汝儂}} !! you (''plural'')
| ''ni neiŋ'' || ''li laŋ'' || ''lin'' ({{zh-l|*恁}}) || ''tyøŋ'' ({{zh-l|*長}})
|-
! {{zh-l|*伊儂}} !! they
| ''i neiŋ'' || ''i laŋ'' || ''in'' ({{zh-l|*𪜶}}) || ''yøŋ'' ({{zh-l|*𪜶}})
|}

: A similar chain of changes happened in the Wu dialects to arrive at the modern divergent dialectal forms for “you (''singular'')”. In Shanghai and some other Wu dialects, the first syllable had become elided, leaving {{lang|zh|儂}} to mean “you (''singular'')”.

With regard to the etymology of this word, {{zh-ref|Huang (1980)}}, {{zh-ref|Norman (1983)}} and {{zh-ref|Zhou (1986)}} hypothesised that this is the same as {{och-l|農|farmer; peasant}}. The use of this word as a pronoun may have originated as a form of personal deprecation and then come to be used as a full-fledged pronoun. {{zh-ref|Pan and Chen (1995)}} considered this theory implausible, and proposed that this was originally a {{w|Baiyue}} substrate word, possibly of {{der|zh|qfa-tak}} origin. The initial meaning of ''nong'' was possibly a clan name, later developing to mean “person; I”. Compare {{cog|za|Nungz||''a surname''}} and name of the 11<sup>th</sup> century [[Zhuang]] leader {{w|Nong Zhigao}}, as well as the name of the {{w|Nùng}} people in Vietnam.

# {{qualifier|mainly Western Japan}} [[I]], [[me]]

=====Usage notes=====
The term is a regular pronoun in Western Japan, used primarily by men in most regions. Depending on the region, it may be used mainly by the elderly, which is especially true for women using it, and becoming more true as usage of local variants declines in younger generations. Its use is often considered stereotypical of old people in Japanese media and is frequently used in TV shows and comics to emphasize the age of characters. However, it may also simply be used to emphasize the character as hailing from [[Kansai]].

More commonly spelled {{m|ja|私}}, or in [[kana#English|kana]] to make the reading explicit.

===Etymology 2===
{{ja-kanjitab|yomi=k|かれ}}
From {{inh|ja|ojp|-|sort=かれ}}. Compound of {{suffix|ja|sort=かれ|彼|tr1=ka|t1=that, yon|れ|tr2=re|pos2=nominalizing suffix for demonstratives}}. Found in the [[w:Man'yōshū|''Man'yōshū'']] compiled around 759.

====Pronunciation====
{{ja-pron|yomi=k|かれ|acc=1|acc_ref=DJR}}

====Alternative forms====
* {{ja-l|彼}} {{qualifier|more common}}

====Pronoun====
