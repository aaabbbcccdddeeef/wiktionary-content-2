===Etymology===
{{Han etyl}}
{{liushu|p}} – footprint (pointing down), variant of [[夂]]. Compare [[止]], which has similar form in oracle script, but has leg pointing up, and [[𡕒]] (as in right side of [[舛]], roughly [[ヰ]]), which also has leg pointing down, but toe pointing left, hence different evolutions.

===Usage notes===
This character is usually written as the bottom component of a character and is not to be confused with [[夂]] which is often written as the top component of a character or [[攵]] which is often written as the right component of a character. Traditionally, this character is written with the final [[㇏]] stroke slightly protruding above [[ク]].
