Traditionally, this character is written with the final [[㇏]] stroke slightly protruding above {{l|mul|ク}}.

===Glyph origin===
{{Han etym}}
{{liushu|p}} – footprint (pointing down), variant of [[夂]]. Compare [[止]], which has similar form in oracle script, but has leg pointing up, and [[𡕒]] (as in right side of [[舛]], roughly [[ヰ]]), which also has leg pointing down, but toe pointing left, hence different evolutions.
