===Glyph origin===
{{Han etym}}
{{liushu|p}}: a newborn baby, shown upside down. The upper portion is an inverted [[子]]. The three lower lines represent amniotic fluid or hair, the latter interpretation thought almost certainly incorrect by Henshall.<ref>Henshall, Kenneth G. (1998). A Guide to Remembering Japanese Characters (2nd ed.). Singapore: Tuttle Publishing. p. 124. {{ISBN|978-0-8048-2038-7}}</ref> The interpretation as fluid is supported by the comparison of {{l|zh|旒}} and {{l|zh|游}}, originally variants of one another.  (Note that the oracle bone form of 子 also depicted hair.){{rfv-etymology|mul}}
