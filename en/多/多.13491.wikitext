===Etymology===
{{Han etyl}}
{{liushu|p}} – two pieces of meat ([[⺼]]); the ⺼ components have been simplified to [[夕]].

The conventional explanation is that this represented the concept of "many" through visual repetition. However, the earliest oracle bones use 多 for both "many" and another word meaning "to separate," thus suggesting that 多 depicts a piece of meat cut in two. The word "to separate" was later written as [[誃]].
