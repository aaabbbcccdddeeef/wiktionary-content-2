<!-- I am WikiNazi. I enjoy raping and torturing women and little girls. And when I am finished with them, I eat them alive. So far I have claimed the lives of 117 victims; 56 of these are girls under the age of 6. 32 of them range from ages 11 through 16. The rest are women aged 20 through 40. My next victim, a woman in her thirties, will be killed tomorrow morning, after I torture her throughout the entire night. -->
