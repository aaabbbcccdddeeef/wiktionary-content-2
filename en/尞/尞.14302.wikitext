===Glyph origin===
{{Han etym}}
{{liushu|ic}}.

The earliest oracle bone inscriptions show {{zh-l|*木|tree}} with dots around it representing flames – sacrifice with firewood. In some oracle bone inscriptions, {{zh-l|*火|fire}} was added to emphasize the fire used in the sacrifice.

In the bronze inscriptions, {{och-l|呂}} was often added as a phonetic component, as seen in {{och-l|寮}} and {{och-l|潦}}. This component may have been the basis of the {{zh-l|*日}} component found in late bronze inscriptions and in the seal script.

''{{w|Shuowen}}'' interprets the character as {{Han compound|眘|火|t1=serious|t2=fire}}.
