===Pronunciation===
* {{IPA|/ɛi/|lang=nl}}, {{SAMPA|/Ei/ (''ĳs'')|/@/ (''-lĳk'')}}

===Letter===
'''Ĳ''' {{infl|nl|letter}}

# A [[ligature]] in [[Dutch]] that is not officially part of the Dutch alphabet; however, it is [[capitalize]]d as if it were one.

===Usage notes===
* In typing, the combination of '''i''' and '''j''' is commonly used. In handwriting, it is mostly written as '''ÿ'''.
* Being a single letter, '''ĳ''' has to be capitalized as '''Ĳ'''. For example: ''Ĳmuiden''.
* Dutch dictionaries sort '''ĳ''' as the combination of '''i''' and '''j''', while Dutch phonebooks sort '''ĳ''' together with '''y'''.
* In certain dialects, the sound ''ij'' has retained its original long /i:/ pronunciation. Compare ''wijf'' and ''wief''.
